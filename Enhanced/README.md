# Enhanced

Essentially a modpack built to *enhance* Zen, by either adding missing styling, or *fixing* current one.

Built to be used with [Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine), as it uses some JS to archive its functionality.

For now it's focus is to port existing Zen mods and expend them with JS.
